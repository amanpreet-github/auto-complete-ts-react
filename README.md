# Vite + React + TypeScript Project

This project is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and efficient build tool for modern web applications, with React and TypeScript.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or later) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** (latest version recommended)

### **2️⃣ Installation**
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn install
```

### **3️⃣ Running the Development Server**
To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```
This will start the Vite development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

### **4️⃣ Build for Production**
To create a production build, run:
```sh
npm run build  # or yarn build
```
The optimized files will be available in the `dist/` folder.

### **5️⃣ Preview Production Build**
You can preview the production build locally:
```sh
npm run preview  # or yarn preview
```

## 🔧 Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` → Starts the development server
- `npm run build` → Builds the project for production
- `npm run preview` → Previews the production build
- `npm run lint` → Runs ESLint for code quality checks

## **==NOTE==: The search API is deployed on a free serving so sometimes due to long idle condition it takes 30 to 40 secs for the intial request to respond(spin the server again). If you face a simillar issue please try 2 to 3 time then it should work fine. **

🚀 **Happy coding!** 🎉
